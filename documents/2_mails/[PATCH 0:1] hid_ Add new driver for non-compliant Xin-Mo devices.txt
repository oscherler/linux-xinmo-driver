Subject: [PATCH 0/1] hid: Add new driver for non-compliant Xin-Mo devices.
Date: Sat, 27 Jul 2013 19:20:01 +0200

From: Olivier Scherler <oscherler@ithink.ch>

The Xin-Mo Dual Arcade Controller sends axis values that are out of
range with respect to the HID report descriptor. This patch adds a
driver to correct the input values so they are not thrown out by the
range check in hid-input.c.

The issue is discussed here: <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1077359>

checkpatch.pl gives warnings for two lines that are over 80 characters,
but I decided not to change them since similar lines in other HID
drivers. The third warning asks for a paragraph that describes the new
config symbol in Kconfig fully. I will gladly accept advice on how to
improve it.

This has been tested on Ubuntu Desktop 13.04 in a VMware VM and on a
Raspberry Pi running Raspbian.
