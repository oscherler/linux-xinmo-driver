    HID: Kconfig: drop remove Unicode non-breaking space from Kconfig
    
    There is a UTF-8 non-breaking space character (0xc2 0xa0) after the "Y"
    in "Say Y here". This is probably not intentional. Replace it with a
    standard ASCII space (0x20).
    
    If you can't see a difference here, I don't blame you :)
